# Kernel Development

Learning OS development from scratch by building a simple x86 kernel.

Starting with a basic bootloader in assembly, then working through real mode, protected mode, interrupts, disk I/O, and eventually loading a 32-bit kernel into memory.

This is a work in progress - I'm adding more lessons as I learn.

Each numbered folder is a different lesson/stage. Check the README in each one for the details on what that lesson covers.
